I have implemented the concept of Sparse Matrix in C Programming Language by using general two dimensional arrays(matrix), and also by using Dynamic Memory Allocation.
The goal of both the programs is to check whether the matrix entered by the user is a sparse matrix or not. If it is a sparse matrix then display the triplet representation of the inputted sparse matrix otherwise display the suitable error message.
I have implmented several methods in both the programs in order to achieve modularity and to carry out different subtasks efficiently which are offered by the problem.
Please feel free to contribute to this repository by providing valuabe suggestions.
